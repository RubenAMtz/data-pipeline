# Data Pipeline

Data cleaning, manipulation and visualization over experimental data for hardware testing

The code files presented in this repo were developed during my work placement at a hardware design company. Surprisingly
some teams were still running experiments for hardware testing and analyzing the produced data by hand using MS Excel. I felt motivated
to work in this personal project as the time it was taking the teams to run the analysis was over the top, some of them hired interns
just to do that job almost every day.

Main motivators:

- Reduce time of analysis (from 3 months to a few hours).
- Reduce human error (automated pipeline).
- Increase time to market of products.
- Spend resources in more important issues.
- Increase productivity.
- Get a job offer ;-)

Things to consider:

- The data in the files has been modified so that sensitive information is not revealed.
- The size of the files presented are mere samples of the real ones, data would accumulate for months with 1 sample/second per sensor.
- The code is in R as I was more confident of the language at the time (thanks to Coursera)

# Radar experiments

The files in this folder are related to files generated by ADAR*.R files (at the root) as visualization and monitoring tools 
during real experimental sessions.

- 308 hours report represents one of the extracted report at 308 hours.
- The hours report is a representation of the real physical boards:

- The html report is just a dynamic report that was integrated to the website of the team.
- Data loose pattern report visualizes errors in the data adquisicion system.
- Temperature report is the temperature reported by a temperature sensor in the sockets.

# Biometric experiments

- Amplitudes and Frequencies deviation were important and so reports for these matters were created.
- The reports mimic the physical configuration of the booard
- ADUX2070*.R correspond to this pipeline

# ASIC experiments

- Failure per socket was important, reports for these were created.
- ADUX1060*.R files correspond to this pipeline

# Others

JMP_migration.R is a file for data manipulation to adjust it to the statistics department needs as the company wanted to 
implement these pipelines in JMP Software.
